## Getting and Cleaning Data: Course Project
##### Fumito Hiraoka

### Description

The objective of this course project is to demonstrate understanding of the tidy data concept and to transform a provided raw dataset into an analysis-ready tidy dataset. 

### Source Dataset

The UCI HAR Dataset is described in its *README.txt* file as:

> The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The source dataset can be found at [UCI HAR Dataset] (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)
 
More information for this dataset can be found at [The UCI Machine Learning Repository] (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

### Files in this repository

-README.md: is this file which describes the overview of the course project. 

-CodeBook.md: explains how the source dataset is transformed into a tidy dataset through the five steps including how the features are extracted and how the subjects and activities are identified. 

-run_analysis.R: is the script to perform the transformations which closely follows the five steps.

-tidy_mean.txt: is the output text file from running *run_analysis.R* that consists of the mean values of sixty-six features per subject and per activity.    

### Instructions
    
1. Put *run_analysis.R* along with the *UCI HAR Dataset* folder in your working directory.
    
2. Run the *run_analysis.R* script, it will output the text file, *tidy_mean.txt* in your working directory.
